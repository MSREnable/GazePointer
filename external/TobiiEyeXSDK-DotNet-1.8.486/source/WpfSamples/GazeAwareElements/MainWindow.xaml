    <!-- This WPF sample illustrates how FrameworkElements can be made responsive to eye-gaze
         by setting the Gaze-aware Behavior on them.
    
         Gaze-aware interaction works like this for the user:
         The user looks at some element or area on the screen long enough, and the application
         responds to the eye-gaze in some manner. It could be changing something in the user
         interface or it could be changing state under the hood in order to create a better
         user experience.
        
         Read more about the Gaze-aware Behavior and its associated concepts in the 
         Developer's Guide (available online and in the SDK docs/ folder) -->

    <Window.Resources>
        <!-- We make use of the attached properties provided in the EyeXFramework.Wpf namespace to 
             make a FrameworkElement Gaze-aware and specify its behavior.
       
             When the user's eye-gaze falls within the bounds of a Gaze-aware element, the 
             EyeXFramework sets the attached property Behavior.HasGaze of that element to true, 
             and raises the RoutedEvent Behavior.HasGazeChanged. 
        
             When the eye-gaze is no longer within the bounds of the element, the HasGaze
             property is set to false, and a HasGazeChanged event is yet again raised.
        
             There is also a Gaze-aware delay property. This delay is set to the number of 
             milliseconds we want the eye-gaze to have been within the bounds of the element 
             before the HasGaze property is set to true and the HasGazeEvent is raised. 
        
             A long enough delay increases the probability that the HasGaze property is only set
             to true when the user is intentionally focusing his or her eye-gaze on the element.
        
             Without a delay, and with a delay that is too short, the element will react to 
             unintentional glances. 
        
             On the other hand, if the delay is too long, the interaction will not be
             responsive enough, and the user will percieve it as slow.
        
             Try and change the delay up and down and run the sample to get a feeling for
             the tradeoff between a stable and a responsive user experience. -->

             property is set to true when the eye-gaze falls within the Gaze-aware element.
        
             By use of a trigger on the Behavior.HasGaze property we can change the element's
             background to different colors depending on whether HasGaze is true or not.

                 the user could end up in a frustrating loop when closing the instruction:
                 Animation and movements attracts the attention of the eye, so when the instruction
                 text is changed from the full length text to the short teaser, the eye-gaze is
                 attracted to the newly displayed teaser text. With a short gaze aware delay, the
                 instruction would be re-opened just after the user had closed it. -->

            <!-- We use a data trigger bound to a property in the MainWindowModel to govern 
                 the displaying of the instruction teaser and full instruction text. -->
            <Style.Triggers>
                <!-- The ShowInstruction property in the MainWindowModel is set to true when there
                     is a HasGazeChanged event with HasGaze == true. 
                
                     The ShowInstruction property is set to false when the user presses the 'c' key
                     on the keyboard. 
                
                     So, the user opens the instruction by just looking, but closes it by pressing
                     a key on the keyboard.
                
                     Why is the interaction asymmetrical? Why are we using keyboard input for 
                     closing the instruction instead of setting the ShowInstruction property to
                     false when there is a HasGazeChanged event with HasGaze == false?
                
                     Think about the natural eye movements when reading the instruction. The
                     instruction tells the user how to interact with the elements in the upper
                     part of the sample window. The user's eye-gaze will naturally wander
                     up and down between the elements above and the instruction text below while
                     reading it.
                
                     If we were to close the instruction when the user is temporarily looking
                     above it, the user would have to keep re-opening the instruction text
                     to be able to finish reading it, and that would be a very disruptive and
                     frustrating user experience. (You can try this out by changing the 
                     MainWindowModel to always set the ShowInstruction property to the value
                     of the hasGaze argument in the method NotifyInstructionHasGazeChanged). -->
